Quick Start
==============

Rio is designed to be out-of-the-box, yet powerful to extend. If you
never have experience in using Rio before, this tutorial will help
you getting started.

Getting started with Rio is a three steps process:

* :ref:`installing_the_rio_server`
* :ref:`configure_events_and_their_calling_webhooks`
* :ref:`configure_the_client`

For more details about how to install the Rio server, see :ref:`installation`.

Basically, you need a Unix based OS, Python 2.7. You can use a database as
broker and backend, or use redis as broker and backend, or mix using RabbitMQ
as broker and database as backend. It's all up to you.
